AVL tree is a self balanced binary search tree. That means, an AVL tree is also a binary search tree but it is a balanced tree. A binary tree is said to be balanced, if the difference between the hieghts of left and right subtrees of every node in the tree is either -1, 0 or +1. In other words, a binary tree is said to be balanced if for every node, height of its children differ by at most one. In an AVL tree, every node maintains a extra information known as balance factor. The AVL tree was introduced in the year of 1962 by G.M. Adelson-Velsky and E.M. Landis.
